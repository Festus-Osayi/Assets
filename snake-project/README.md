# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game using Python, Turtle graphics, text file for high scores storage, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## About

Snake Game is a single-player arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer. The objective is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Single-player game-play.
- Control the snake using keyboard arrow keys.
- Score tracking to keep track of points.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
- Simple graphics rendered using the Turtle graphics library.
- High scores storage in a text file.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach for game development.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Simply download or clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone hhttps://github.com/Festus-Osayi/Assets.git
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Assets/snake-project
```

2. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.

## Gameplay

- The game begins with a snake consisting of one segment and a food pellet on the screen.
- The snake moves continuously in the direction determined by the player's input.
- The objective is to guide the snake to eat the food pellets, which causes the snake to grow longer.
- As the snake grows longer, the game's difficulty increases.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- The player's score is based on the number of food pellets eaten.
- The high scores are stored in a text file and displayed at the end of each game.
