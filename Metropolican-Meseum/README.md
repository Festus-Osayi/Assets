# Metropolitan Museum of Art Website

Welcome to the Metropolitan Museum of Art website! This project is built using Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, Jotai, and JWT.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Festus-Osayi/Assets.git
cd Assets/Metropolican-Meseum
```

2. NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL= this api endpoint does all the heavy lifting , you can use any public API or create your own backend to provide data for the museum's eg: [user endpoint](https://github.com/Festus-Osayi/users-api)

3. Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine,

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses bootstrap [`google/Lato`](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400&display=swap) to automatically optimize and load Lato, a custom Google Font.
